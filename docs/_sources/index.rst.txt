i18n
====

A library that assists in creating a Kivy app with internationalization support.

It's composed of the following two primary components:

* The **Font Finder** helps you find fonts.
  If your app doesn't need i18n support, and you just want to use pre-installed fonts to saving space, you probably only need this.
* The **Localizer** helps you switch texts and fonts according to "current language".
