kivy_garden.i18n
================

This library provides internationalization (i18n) support for Kivy applications.
It is also useful if you don't need i18n support but want to use pre-installed fonts to save space.

* Go to :doc:`usage` if you are the former.
* Go to :doc:`usage-no-i18n` if you are the latter.
